             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Setup</h4> 
             <p>Players sit around a table with a designated dealer position (marked by a dealer button). The two players to the left of the dealer post the small blind and big blind. Each player receives two private cards (hole cards) dealt face-down.</p> 
        
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Pre-Flop Betting</h4>
             <p>
              Starting with the player to the left of the big blind, each player decides to fold, call the big blind, or raise. Betting continues clockwise until all active players have matched the highest bet.
             </p> 
            
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">The Flop</h4> 
             <p>
              Three community cards are dealt face-up in the center of the table. A new betting round begins with the first active player to the left of the dealer. Players can check, bet, call, raise, or fold.
             </p>
            
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">The Turn</h4> 
             <p>
              A fourth community card is dealt face-up. Another betting round occurs with the same options as the flop.
             </p> 

             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">The River</h4> 
             <p>
              The fifth and final community card is dealt face-up. The final betting round takes place.
             </p>

             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Showdown</h4> 
             <p>
              If more than one player remains after the final betting round, players reveal their hole cards. The player with the best five-card hand (using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards) wins the pot.
             </p>
            
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Winning</h4> 
             <p>
             Win by having the best hand at showdown or by being the last player remaining after all others have folded. The pot goes to the winner, and a new hand begins with the dealer button moving one position clockwise.

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Breaking Ties</h4> 
            <p>If two players have the same hand ranking, the player with the highest cards in that hand wins. For example, a pair of Aces beats a pair of Kings. If both hands are identical, the pot is split equally.</p>
            
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Using Community Cards</h4>
             <p>
              You can use both of your hole cards, one hole card, or none of your hole cards (playing the board) to make your best five-card hand. The best possible combination wins.
