      <h2> Game Play</h2>
      
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Setup: </h4> 
            <p>Deal 7 cards to each player (5 cards if playing with 4+ players). Place remaining cards face-down as the stock pile. Players look at their cards and keep them hidden.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Taking Turns:</h4>
            <p>
            On your turn, ask any opponent for cards of a specific rank that you already hold (e.g., "Do you have any 5s?"). You must have at least one card of that rank in your hand to ask for it.
           </p> 

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Receiving Cards: </h4> 
            <p>
            If the opponent has cards of that rank, they must give you all of them. You can continue asking any player for cards as long as you receive matches.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Go Fish:</h4> 
            <p>
             If the opponent doesn't have the requested rank, they say "Go Fish!" Draw one card from the stock pile. If you draw the rank you asked for, reveal it and take another turn. Otherwise, your turn ends.
            </p> 

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Making books: </h4> 
            <p>
            When you collect all four cards of the same rank, immediately place the book face-up in front of you and remove it from your hand.
            </p> 

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Winning: - </h4> 
            <p>
              The game ends when all books are completed or the stock pile runs out. The player with the most books wins!
