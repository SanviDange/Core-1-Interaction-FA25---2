             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Setup</h4> 
             <p>Players sit in a circle and agree on the boot amount (minimum stake). Each player contributes the boot to the pot. A standard 52-card deck is used, with Aces ranking highest and 2s ranking lowest.</p> 
        
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">The Deal</h4>
             <p>
              The dealer distributes three cards face-down to each player, one at a time in clockwise order. Players can choose to look at their cards (becoming "seen") or play without looking (staying "blind").
             </p> 
            
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Betting Rounds</h4> 
             <p>
              Starting with the player to the dealer's left, players take turns betting. Blind players bet the current stake, while seen players must bet double. Players can bet, raise (up to 4x current stake), call for a sideshow (if applicable), request a show (when only two players remain), or fold. Betting continues until only one player remains or two players agree to a show.
             </p>
            
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Sideshow Rules</h4> 
             <p>
              A seen player can request a sideshow with the previous player if that player is also seen. The previous player can accept or decline. If accepted, both players privately compare hands, and the player with the weaker hand must fold. If the hands are equal, the player who requested the sideshow must fold.
             </p> 
            
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">The Showdown</h4> 
             <p>
             When only two players remain, either can pay for a show (blind players pay the current stake, seen players pay double). Both players reveal their cards, and the player with the better hand wins the pot. If both hands are equal, the player who did not pay for the show wins.

           <main class="medium-style">
           
            <p>Hands are ranked from highest to lowest:</p>
            <ul style="color: var(--color-secondary);">
            <li><strong>Trail (Three of a Kind)</strong> - Three cards of the same rank (e.g., A♠ A♥ A♦). A-A-A is the best trail.</li>
            <li><strong>Pure Sequence (Straight Flush)</strong> - Three consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., K♥ Q♥ J♥). A-K-Q is the best sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Sequence (Straight)</strong> - Three consecutive cards not all in the same suit (e.g., K♥ Q♠ J♦).</li>
            <li><strong>Color (Flush)</strong> - Three cards of the same suit that are not in sequence (e.g., A♠ K♠ 9♠).</li>
            <li><strong>Pair</strong> - Two cards of the same rank (e.g., K♥ K♠ 5♦). A-A-K is the best pair.</li>
            <li><strong>High Card</strong> - None of the above. The hand with the highest card wins (e.g., A♥ J♠ 9♦).</li>
            </ul> 
            <br>

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Comparing Hands</h4> 
            <p>When hands are of the same type, compare the highest card. For trails and pairs, compare the rank of the matching cards first. For sequences, A-K-Q is highest, then K-Q-J, down to 4-3-2, with A-2-3 being the lowest sequence.</p>
            
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Winning Strategies</h4>
             <p>
              Playing blind can be advantageous as you bet half the amount of seen players. Bluffing is crucial—you can win with weak hands if opponents fold. Watch betting patterns and know when to fold to minimize losses. Sideshow requests can help eliminate opponents before the final showdown.
             </p> 
            
             <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent);">Variations</h4> 
             <p>
              Many regional variations exist, including Muflis (lowest hand wins), AK47 (A, K, 4, and 7 are wild cards), and Best of Four (deal four cards, play with best three). House rules should be agreed upon before starting.
