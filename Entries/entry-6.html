      <p>Blackjack is a fast-paced casino card game where players compete against the dealer to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. You beat the dealer's hand to win!</p>

       <h4> Hit</h4>
       <p>When it’s your turn, ‘hitting’ means requesting for another card.</p>
       <h4> Bust</h4>
       <p>When the sum of your cards exceeds 21, you ‘bust’ i,e. you lose the round. </p>
       <h4> Stand</h4>
       <p>When you ‘stand’ or keep the hand you are dealt with and choose not to ‘hit’.</p>
       <h4> Push</h4>
       <p>When both, you and the dealer end the rounds with the same hand value, it's a tie. Your bet is ‘pushed’ or returned.</p>

      <h3 style="background-color: #bc923e; border-radius: 0 20px 20px 0; padding: 0.5rem 0.5rem;"> Increased Difficulty</h2>
         <h4> Insurance</h4>
         <p>If the dealer’s up-facing card is an ace, players will be given the ‘insurance’ option. If the dealer gets blackjack (ace + ten), then players who took insurance will receive a payout.</p>
       
         <h4> Split</h4>
         <p>If you’re given two of the same cards as your starting hand, you can separate the pair and play two hands. You’ll need to double your wager.</p>
       
         <h4> Doubling</h4>
         <p>After your second card is revealed, you’ll be given the option to ‘Double.’ This will double your wager, and you’ll be assigned one more card. After that card is assigned, you won’t have the option to hit. </p>

      <h2> Game Play</h2>  
        <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Setup: - </h4> 
        <p>Deal 7 cards to each player. Place remaining cards face-down as the stock pile. Flip one card face-up to declare a 'joker' and another to start the discard pile.</p> 
        
        <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Card Values: -</h4>
         <p>
         Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and Aces are worth 1 or 11.
         </p> 
            
        <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Player Turns: - </h4> 
         <p>
         Starting from the dealer's left, each player decides to hit, stand, double down, or split. Continue hitting until you stand or bust.
         </p>
            
        <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Dealer's Turn: - </h4> 
         <p>
         After all players finish, the dealer reveals their face-down card. The dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more.
         </p> 
            
        <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Winning: - </h4> 
         <p>
         Beat the dealer by having a higher hand value without busting. Blackjack pays 3:2, regular wins pay 1:1. If you and the dealer tie, it's a push (bet returned).
