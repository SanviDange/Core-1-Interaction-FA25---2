   <h2> Common Terms</h2>
   <h4>Hit</h4>
   <p>When it’s your turn, ‘hitting’ means requesting for another card.</p>
   <h4>Bust</h4>
   <p>When the sum of your cards exceeds 21, you ‘bust’ i,e. you lose the round.</p>
   <h4>Stand</h4>
   <p>When you ‘stand’ or keep the hand you are dealt with and choose not to ‘hit’.</p>
   <h4>Push</h4>
   <p>When both, you and the dealer end the rounds with the same hand value, it's a tie. Your bet is ‘pushed’ or returned.</p>
   <h4>Split</h4>
   <p>If you’re given two of the same cards as your starting hand, you can separate the pair and play two hands. You’ll need to double your wager.</p>
