      <h2> Game Play</h2>
      
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Setup: - </h4> 
            <p>Deal 7 cards to each player. Place remaining cards face-down as the stock pile. Flip one card face-up to declare a 'joker' and another to start the discard pile.</p> 
        
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Taking Turns: -</h4>
            <p>
            On your turn (typically table moves clockwise), draw one card from either the stock pile or discard pile, then discard one card face-up. 
            At the end of each round you should have no-more or no-less than 7 cards in hand. 
           </p> 
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Forming Combinations: - </h4> 
            <p>
            Arrange your cards into valid sequences and sets. You must have at least one pure sequence to declare.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Declaring: - </h4> 
            <p>
              When all your cards form valid combinations, discard your final card and declare. Other players reveal their hands and calculate points for unmatched cards.
            </p> 
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Winning: - </h4> 
            <p>
              The player who declares first wins the round. Points are tallied based on unmatched cards in opponents' hands.
