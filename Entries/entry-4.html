     <p>Bluff is a fast-paced card game of deception where players race to get rid of all their cards by playing them face-down in sequence. You can lie about what you're playing, but if someone catches your bluff, you'll pick up the entire pile!</p>

        <h2> Game Play</h2>
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Setup: </h4> 
            <p>Deal all cards evenly among players. Some players may have one extra card. Players hold their cards without showing them to others.</p> 
        
            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Taking Turns: -</h4>
            <p>
            Starting with Aces, players take turns placing cards face-down in the center while announcing the required rank (Aces, then 2s, then 3s, etc.). You must play 1-4 cards and claim they match the current rank.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Bluffing:  </h4> 
            <p>
             If you don't have the required rank, play any cards face-down and lie about them. Make it convincing!
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;">Calling a Bluff:  </h4> 
            <p>
             If you suspect someone is lying, call "Bluff!" (or "Cheat!" or "I doubt it!"). Reveal the cards just played. If they lied, they take the entire pile. If they were truthful, you take the pile.
            </p> 

            <h4 style="color: var(--color-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:medium;"> Winning: - </h4> 
            <p>
              The first player to get rid of all their cards wins. Strategic bluffing and careful observation are key to victory!
